# Gridrise

A standalone, light-theme desktop web app for chatting with agent
`agent_bb34ddbfd404477ba07cb9267ad6899b`. Built from
[agent-starter](https://github.com/scottopolis/agent-starter), with a new Gridrise
Sessions API backend and WebSocket transport. No OpenAI key is needed.

## Run locally

Requires Node 22 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
cp .env.gridrise.example .env
# Set GRIDRISE_API_KEY in .env using your editor (never commit it).
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. Both services bind to loopback by default;
there is no sign-in and this app must not be deployed publicly as-is.

In **Gridrise → Account → API keys**, create a key bound to the agent above.
Set `GRIDRISE_API_KEY` in the server `.env`, then restart `npm run dev`.
The key is used only by the Node backend to call the production
`POST /v1/agent-sessions?agentId=…` endpoint with `{"purpose":"api"}`.
The browser receives only the short-lived session handoff and connects directly
to the returned WebSocket. Keys and handoff credentials are never stored in chat history.

Without a key, the app shows setup guidance. It does not pretend to answer with
mock content. `GRIDRISE_APP_ORIGIN` optionally allows one exact alternate app
origin for a private development preview; do not use a wildcard.

## Chat history and limitations

- The sidebar retains the 10 most recently used chats in this browser's localStorage.
  Starting an empty chat does not evict an existing one until you send a message.
- Titles come from the first message. Delete removes a local saved transcript;
  it does not delete Gridrise's server-side conversation records.
- Refresh restores the latest chat. Reopening a chat or renewing an expired
  credential starts a fresh API interaction with the saved text context. This
  preserves conversational text, not the original server interaction or tool state.
- Streaming text, Markdown, Enter to send, Shift+Enter for a newline, Stop, and
  retry are supported. Stop disconnects the stream; it does not guarantee that
  server-side tools already running are canceled.
- This version is text chat only: no uploads, voice, browser tools, or approval UI.
  Agent-side tools may run, but their payloads are not displayed or persisted.
- Transcripts are unencrypted browser-local data. Clearing site data removes them.
  Use your own browser profile for personal conversations.

```sh
npm run build
npm test
```

The original starter's reusable library and example source are retained below
for reference. Their provider/MCP server is not part of `npm run dev` for Gridrise.

## Original starter reference: Agent Widget

A reusable, provider-neutral React chat UI for standard AI SDK UI messages, plus a thin working example. Its compound components let applications compose a controlled chat from a few substantial pieces. `ChatSurface` and the `useChat`-powered `ChatWidget` remain ready-made presets built from those same pieces.

The example adds a standalone chat, iframe embed and launcher, Node/AI SDK backend, Human-in-the-Loop tool approvals, optional external MCP servers, and isolated inline MCP App rendering. Provider and MCP host code are example-only and are not imported by the library entry point.

MCP is optional. With no provider or MCP configuration, ordinary chat runs in deterministic mock mode.

## Install the library

The package exports `Chat`, `ChatSurface`, `ChatWidget`, `DefaultToolRenderer`, their prop/context types, and `@scottopolis/agent-widget/styles.css`. `ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`, React, and React DOM are compatible peer dependencies; provider packages and the experimental MCP renderer are not library runtime dependencies.

Compose `Chat.Root`, `Chat.Transcript`, `Chat.Empty`, `Chat.Messages`, `Chat.Composer`, `Chat.Input`, and `Chat.Send` when the host owns transport, persistence, recovery, or optimistic state:

```tsx
import { Chat } from '@scottopolis/agent-widget';
import '@scottopolis/agent-widget/styles.css';

<Chat.Root
  messages={chat.messages}
  status={chat.status}
  actions={{
    sendMessage: chat.sendMessage,
    stop: chat.stop,
    regenerate: chat.regenerate,
    addToolApprovalResponse: chat.addToolApprovalResponse,
    setMessages: chat.setMessages,
  }}
  title="Support chat"
>
  <YourHeader />
  <Chat.Transcript>
    <Chat.Empty>How can we help?</Chat.Empty>
    <Chat.Messages
      showProgress={!isRecovering}
      renderTool={(part, context) => {
        if (!mayDisplayTool(part)) return null;
        return renderKnownTool(part) ?? context.renderDefault();
      }}
    />
    {isRecovering && <RecoveryIndicator />}
    {safeError && <SafeError error={safeError} retry={chat.regenerate} />}
  </Chat.Transcript>
  <footer className="composer-wrap">
    <YourBrowserToolControls />
    <Chat.Composer>
      <Chat.Input ref={composerRef} placeholder="Ask a question…" />
      <YourExtraControl />
      <Chat.Send />
    </Chat.Composer>
    <p>AI can make mistakes. Check important information.</p>
  </footer>
</Chat.Root>
```

`Chat.Root` scopes styles and shares the controlled messages, status, and actions. `Chat.Transcript` owns the accessible live log and follow-scroll behavior. `Chat.Messages` renders standard message parts; its `renderTool` is authoritative, so `null` or `undefined` suppresses a tool and a tool-only row without leaking names, inputs, results, or a fallback. Call `context.renderDefault()` only when raw default tool output is appropriate. `Chat.Composer` owns its draft, duplicate-submit lock, and rejected-send recovery. `Chat.Input` accepts normal textarea props and a ref while preserving Enter, Shift+Enter, and IME behavior. `Chat.Send` switches between submit and stop, including empty-assistant cleanup after stop.

The `actions` object accepts `sendMessage({ text })`, `stop()`, `regenerate()`, `addToolApprovalResponse(response)`, and optional `setMessages(update)`. Header, disclaimer, errors, recovery state, and extra controls are ordinary React children, so they can be reordered without adding layout props. User content is rendered as literal React text; only assistant text is parsed as Markdown with raw HTML disabled.

Pass a ref directly to `Chat.Input` to focus or measure a composed input. Each input also has the stable `data-agent-chat-composer` attribute for delegated host events; prefer the ref when targeting one of multiple chats.

### Response actions and suggested prompts

Use the `Chat.Messages` child function to compose optional content for a specific rendered assistant response. Put ordinary feedback or copy controls first, followed by generic suggestion components:

```tsx
<Chat.Messages renderTool={renderTool}>
  {(message) => {
    const suggestions = suggestionsByMessageId[message.id] ?? [];
    const showActions = mayActOnResponse(message);
    if (!showActions && suggestions.length === 0) return null;
    return (
      <Chat.ResponseFooter>
        {showActions && (
          <div className="response-actions" aria-label="Response actions">
            <button type="button" aria-label="Like" onClick={() => saveFeedback(message.id, 'like')}><ThumbsUp /></button>
            <button type="button" aria-label="Dislike" onClick={() => saveFeedback(message.id, 'dislike')}><ThumbsDown /></button>
            <button type="button" aria-label="Copy" onClick={() => copyResponse(message)}><Copy /></button>
          </div>
        )}
        {suggestions.length > 0 && (
          <Chat.Suggestions>
            {suggestions.map((suggestion) => (
              <Chat.Suggestion key={suggestion.prompt} prompt={suggestion.prompt}>
                {suggestion.label}
              </Chat.Suggestion>
            ))}
          </Chat.Suggestions>
        )}
      </Chat.ResponseFooter>
    );
  }}
</Chat.Messages>
```

`Chat.Suggestion` submits its `prompt` through the same guarded action path as the composer; its child is only the display label. Suggestions are disabled while a send is pending or the chat is submitted/streaming, and rejected sends are contained so the control can be retried. The child function runs only for assistant messages with rendered content, so an authoritative `renderTool` suppression cannot be bypassed by a footer.

The host owns deriving `suggestionsByMessageId` from whatever LLM output contract it chooses and owns feedback persistence. Actions and suggestions are independent: either can render without the other. The library requires no tool, schema, message metadata, provider, or generation convention. Return `null` when a response has neither actions nor suggestions; the default presets render no response footer.

For the original controlled preset, use `ChatSurface`. It assembles the same compound components and keeps its existing presentation props, including `header`, `statusContent`, `beforeComposer`, `composerRef`, `disclaimer`, `renderError`, and `renderTool`:

```tsx
<ChatSurface messages={chat.messages} status={chat.status} actions={chat} />
```

For a conventional AI SDK HTTP transport, `ChatWidget` owns `useChat` and accepts all presentation props above:

```tsx
import { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';
import { ChatWidget } from '@scottopolis/agent-widget';
import '@scottopolis/agent-widget/styles.css';

<ChatWidget transport={new DefaultChatTransport({ api: '/api/chat' })} />
```

`ChatWidget.id` is an initial conversation ID, not a controlled prop. Remount the wrapper to switch to an externally selected ID. `requestedPrompt` is consumed once per prompt ID, including across the wrapper's New chat reset; supply a new ID to request another send.

### Consume an exact merged revision from Git

Pin the full merge commit so every installation receives the same source:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@scottopolis/agent-widget": "github:scottopolis/agent-starter#FULL_MERGE_COMMIT_SHA"
  }
}
```

The repository does not commit generated library output. Its `prepare` script builds ESM, CSS, and declarations when installed from Git. pnpm 10 may require explicit approval before it runs a Git dependency's build script; review the pinned source, run `pnpm approve-builds`, and approve `@scottopolis/agent-widget` if prompted. Commit the resulting pnpm build-policy and lockfile changes. If organizational policy forbids dependency build scripts, use a reviewed tarball produced by `npm pack`, or a future registry release; neither is published by this repository.

### Styling and extension boundaries

All library selectors are under `.agent-chat`; the stylesheet has no `:root`, `html`, `body`, global font, or global control rules. Override custom properties on the component root using its `className` or `style` prop:

```css
.my-assistant {
  --agent-chat-accent: #173b33;
  --agent-chat-accent-hover: #225347;
  --agent-chat-header-text: white;
  --agent-chat-header-muted: #cbdad5;
  --agent-chat-avatar-bg: #dff1ea;
  --agent-chat-paper: #fffefb;
  --agent-chat-ink: #17211e;
  --agent-chat-muted: #697672;
  --agent-chat-line: #dfe6e3;
}
```

Pass `className="my-assistant"` to `Chat.Root`, `ChatSurface`, or `ChatWidget`. On the presets, replace the default header with `header`; `header={null}`, `welcome={null}`, and `disclaimer={null}` suppress those defaults. `renderTool` is the tool/MCP boundary. Keep MCP credentials, authorization, sandbox policy, and consequential tool execution outside this library.

Runtime branding can use the standard root `style` prop, which also types the variables above: `<ChatSurface style={{ '--agent-chat-accent': brandColor }} ... />`. Standalone mode defaults to a full-page presentation. `embedded` mode fills its containing block instead; give the parent an explicit height (for example `height: 620px`) or set `--agent-chat-height` on the surface.

## Quickstart: ordinary chat

Requirements for the example: Node.js 22 or newer. Its pinned AI SDK React and MCP packages require Node 22.

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env # optional
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/` for standalone chat or `http://localhost:5173/example.html` for the sample site and floating embed. `npm run dev` starts the web app, chat API, and the separate-origin sandbox service; no MCP server is required.

### Connect an LLM provider

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`; the executable backend uses `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`). Provider credentials stay in Node and are never returned to the browser. `MAX_STEPS` configures the agent tool-loop limit from 1–100 (default 5).

`createChatServer` accepts any AI SDK `LanguageModel`, so applications can inject another provider without changing the server module. Environment and OpenAI wiring live only in the executable entry point:

```ts
const server = createChatServer({ model: myLanguageModel, maxSteps: 8, mcp: registry });
```

## Human-in-the-Loop tool approvals

In provider mode, ask **“Issue a demo refund of $25 to Alex.”** The built-in simulated refund tool demonstrates the complete approval flow without making an external change:

1. The model requests `issue_demo_refund` with its proposed input.
2. The AI SDK emits an `approval-requested` tool part and pauses before `execute` runs.
3. The default `ChatSurface` tool renderer shows Approve and Deny controls. It submits the decision with `addToolApprovalResponse`.
4. The backend accepts only a decision matching its pending, signed approval request and keeps the authoritative tool input from server history.
5. Approval executes the simulated tool; denial returns control to the model without executing it.

To require approval for your own consequential tool, define the tool server-side and add its name to `toolApproval`:

```ts
const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model,
  tools: {
    issue_refund: tool({
      description: 'Issue a customer refund',
      inputSchema: z.object({ amount: z.number().positive(), recipient: z.string() }),
      execute: issueRefund,
    }),
  },
  toolApproval: {
    issue_refund: {
      type: 'user-approval',
      reason: 'Issuing a refund requires your approval.',
    },
  },
  experimental_toolApprovalSecret: approvalSecret,
});
```

On the client, configure `useChat` to continue after every pending decision has a response, then submit the approval ID rendered in the tool part:

```ts
const chat = useChat({
  transport,
  sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses,
});

chat.addToolApprovalResponse({ id: part.approval.id, approved: true });
// or: { id: part.approval.id, approved: false, reason: 'Denied by user' }
```

The existing implementation is in `server/index.ts`; the approval card and client calls are in `src/lib/ChatSurface.tsx`. Keep tool execution and authorization on the server. In production, authenticate the user, authorize the specific action and authoritative input, persist pending approvals and operation IDs, and make consequential operations idempotent. The sample's signing key and conversation state are in memory, so pending approvals do not survive a restart.

## Connect an external MCP server

Set `MCP_SERVERS` to a JSON array. Each `id` namespaces model-facing tool names; `url` is a Streamable HTTP endpoint; optional headers remain server-side.

```dotenv
MCP_SERVERS=[{"id":"support","url":"https://mcp.example.com/mcp","headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer server-only-token"}}]
```

At request time, the backend connects with the official MCP client, advertises `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`, discovers tools, hides app-only tools from the model, converts model-visible schemas into AI SDK tools, executes real tool calls, and streams standard AI SDK UI-message parts over SSE. A tool becomes an inline app when `_meta.ui.resourceUri` is a `ui://` URI and `resources/read` returns `text/html;profile=mcp-app`.

This repository is an MCP client/App host; it does not include an MCP server. It supports external Streamable HTTP servers. Add another client transport in `server/mcp.ts` if you need stdio, and do not connect the browser directly to credentialed MCP services.

## Customize the source

| Concern | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Controlled compound components and normal tool cards | `src/lib/Chat.tsx` |
| Compatible controlled presentation preset | `src/lib/ChatSurface.tsx` |
| `useChat` convenience wrapper | `src/lib/ChatWidget.tsx` |
| Inline app policy and AI SDK renderer | `src/chat/McpApp.tsx` |
| Scoped library colors and responsive layout | `src/lib/styles.css` |
| Example-only page and MCP App styles | `src/app.css` |
| HTTP transport wiring | `src/main.tsx`, `src/embed-main.tsx` |
| LLM/mock orchestration and browser API | `server/index.ts` |
| MCP connection, discovery, grants, calls | `server/mcp.ts` |
| Separate-origin sandbox and CSP | `server/sandbox-server.ts` |
| Embed launcher and parent protocol | `src/embed/loader.ts`, `src/embed-main.tsx` |

The default app uses `@ai-sdk/react` `useChat`, AI SDK `UIMessage`, and `DefaultChatTransport`. To connect another standard UI-message endpoint with the convenience wrapper, pass a transport to `ChatWidget`; authentication headers belong in that transport:

```ts
const transport = new DefaultChatTransport({
  api: '/api/my-assistant',
  headers: async () => ({ authorization: `Bearer ${await getAccessToken()}` }),
});
```

`ChatSurface` consumes standard UI-message text and tool parts rather than a starter-specific message model. Applications using persisted WebSockets, recovery, approvals, optimistic state, or browser-executed tools should retain their own hook/backend and pass its state and actions to this controlled boundary instead of adopting the sample HTTP server.

## Browser/backend contracts

`POST /api/chat` uses the [AI SDK UI message stream protocol](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol) (`text/event-stream`). The browser sends `{ id, messages, trigger, messageId? }`; streamed text and tool calls/results use standard `UIMessageChunk` events. This sample accepts text-only user parts (up to 16,000 characters); it does not accept file or custom data parts. Add a shared application schema before enabling those inputs.

The sample server owns authoritative conversation history in memory, keyed by chat ID. It accepts only the latest validated user message or an approval decision that matches a pending server-generated request; it does not trust browser-supplied tool inputs or outputs. Server-generated tool calls/results persist across turns. Conversations expire after 30 minutes, the least recently used entries are capped at 250, and overlapping turns for one conversation are rejected. `createChatServer` accepts `conversationTtlMs` and `maxConversations` to adjust those bounds.

This is safe only for a single sample process, not durable storage or tenant authorization: conversations and the per-process approval signing key disappear on restart, and the browser-generated opaque chat ID is not an authenticated identity. Production hosts must derive the conversation owner server-side and bind persistent history to that authenticated user/session. The sample also rejects regeneration of any assistant turn containing a tool call because replay could repeat a side effect. A production implementation may instead use tool classifications and persisted idempotency records.

The browser can use only the opaque capability issued for a discovered app tool:

- `POST /api/mcp/apps/resource` with `{ "capabilityId": "..." }` returns `{ html, csp?, permissions?, appTools }`.
- `POST /api/mcp/apps/tool` with `{ "capabilityId": "...", "name": "discovered-app-tool", "arguments": {} }` returns the MCP `CallToolResult`.

The backend ignores browser-selected URLs and reauthorizes the source resource, same MCP connection, and app-visible target tool. Unknown capabilities, resources, and tool names are denied. `isError: true` remains an MCP error result for app calls and is thrown for model execution; it is never presented as model-tool success.

If you replace these endpoints, preserve their constraints and add your own authenticated session binding. The in-memory opaque ID in this sample is capability routing, **not tenant authorization**.

## Sandbox deployment

Web hosts use the MCP Apps double-iframe pattern:

```text
widget origin → trusted sandbox proxy origin → opaque-origin MCP App iframe
```

`server/sandbox-server.ts` must be hosted on a distinct origin (a different port is sufficient locally). Configure both sides:

```dotenv
VITE_MCP_SANDBOX_URL=https://mcp-sandbox.example.com/sandbox
MCP_HOST_ORIGINS=https://chat.example.com
MCP_EMBED_ANCESTOR_ORIGINS=https://www.example.com,https://portal.example.com
```

`VITE_MCP_SANDBOX_URL` is a frontend build setting. `MCP_HOST_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated exact allowlist of widget origins enforced by the sandbox service. `MCP_EMBED_ANCESTOR_ORIGINS` is the non-wildcard allowlist of website origins that may contain the embedded widget **when those origins differ from the widget origin**. A same-origin website needs no extra entry. CSP checks the sandbox's complete frame tree, so explicitly list every different website origin that can be an ancestor. The embed passes its validated parent origin to the sandbox, which rejects unconfigured different origins and emits the configured origins in `frame-ancestors` alongside the widget origin.

Both `dev:sandbox` and `start:sandbox` load these values and `MCP_SANDBOX_PORT` from `.env`. The service also requires a matching widget request referrer, emits restrictive response headers, validates structured CSP origins, and denies undeclared network/frame/base access. It never inserts raw CSP directives. Host and proxy validate exact `postMessage` window sources and origins; the proxy accepts the inner app only from its opaque (`null`) origin.

The pinned experimental `@ai-sdk/react` MCP App renderer handles the Apps bridge lifecycle, and `@ai-sdk/mcp` supplies discovery/resource helpers. The surrounding host still enforces opaque capabilities, app-tool allowlists, exact origins, sandbox CSP, safe absolute HTTP(S) links, bounded height, and initialization timeout. It forwards complete browser-facing tool results—including MCP `_meta`—while `toModelOutput` excludes `_meta` from model input. Failures retain a readable non-interactive tool-result fallback. Because the React renderer is experimental, keep its version pinned and rerun the security and browser tests before upgrading it.

For a production build, serve the widget files/API from your chat origin and run `npm run start:sandbox` behind the configured sandbox origin. Never collapse the sandbox onto the widget origin or replace it with direct `srcdoc` in the host page.

## Embed on a website

`npm run build` produces app pages plus `dist/embed.js`; build output is ignored and is not committed. Serve `embed.js`, `embed.html`, generated assets, `/api/chat`, and `/api/mcp/apps/*` from infrastructure you operate.

```html
<script
  src="https://chat.example.com/embed.js"
  data-widget-url="https://chat.example.com/embed.html"
  data-title="Acme support"
></script>
```

```js
window.AgentWidget.open();
window.AgentWidget.open({ message: 'Help me choose a plan' });
window.AgentWidget.close();
window.AgentWidget.toggle();
```

The launcher uses a closed shadow root and chat runs in an iframe. Parent and child validate exact message origin and window source. Pin `data-widget-url` to an origin you operate; configure non-wildcard CORS deliberately if API and widget origins differ.

## Production responsibilities

This is a starter, not an authorization gateway. Before production:

- Authenticate every browser request and derive user/tenant identity server-side. Bind app capabilities to that authenticated session and conversation; never trust browser identity or assume this sample proxy grants tenant access.
- Authorize each MCP server, model-visible tool, resource, and app-initiated tool call for the current tenant and user. Add approval for consequential actions.
- Enforce approvals and action-specific authorization on the server. A confirmation UI alone is not an authorization boundary; persist approval and tool-operation IDs if an interrupted turn must be safely resumed or retried.
- Store MCP/provider credentials in a secret manager. Redact logs and errors; never put credentials in `VITE_*` variables or app resources.
- Add per-user/IP/tenant rate limits, request/tool-result/token size limits, timeouts, concurrency and spend budgets. The sample has basic body, app HTML, CSP, and message limits only.
- Add persistence, consent, retention/deletion, moderation, structured audit logs, tracing, health checks, and safe retry policy appropriate to your product. Record tool lifecycle transitions before and after consequential calls so a stream failure cannot make a retry duplicate an external side effect.
- Review requested app domains/permissions against your own allow/block policy. Sandboxing limits technical access but does not prevent deceptive UI or all resource-exhaustion attacks.

## Checks

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm audit
```

Tests cover ordinary chat with MCP disabled, standard SSE transport, server-owned tool and approval history, forged approval/history rejection, `_meta` separation, delayed app initialization, denied capabilities/tools, exact source/origin checks, restrictive CSP parsing, embed behavior, and streaming races.
